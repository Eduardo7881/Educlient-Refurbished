# Educlient-Refurbished
EduClient PVP Minecraft Client is on again... kinda.

# What do you mean by "Refurbished"?
it means i am fixing a lot of bugs and adding things based on other clients. like Lunar Client.

My goals is:
1. Not having a lot of bugs, like the Mod Menu which is buggy when the Window is 800x900 or The default res.
2. Active development
3. Always releasing what i added on the client here tbh
4. If i can, Update from Minecraft 1.8 > Minecraft 1.8.8

if you know a bit of Java, OpenGL and Modding Minecraft or making mods experience, feel free to contribute to the Project. It helps me a lot. Probably, ill release the client source code here.

# Bugs and Issues
If you found a Bug/Glitch/Issue on the client, please open a Issue Request so i can fix it.

Actual bugs found:
1. Glitchy Mod Menu render when game window is low. like 800x900 or The default res.

# Actual Mods
1. There is a mod which i forgot da nameðŸ’€, that fixes your pitch and angle of the player. which makes the player moviment fresher. (No Visual)
2. FPS Counter (Visual)
3. Target Name (Visual) Shows the target you're pointing. Skin, name, health.

i plan to add like, Day/Night option, etc...
